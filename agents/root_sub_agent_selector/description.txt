Root Interview Coordinator:
Orchestrates the interview by first running the planner_executor_pipeline (Marcus → Sofia), then routing to the appropriate expert agent (Priya, James, or Aisha) based on Sofia's decision.

Flow:
1. Always calls planner_executor_pipeline first
2. Checks state['executor_output']['action']
3. If topic_selection: displays greeting and waits
4. Otherwise: transfers to ONE expert agent (database_agent, api_agent, or cloud_agent)

This ensures Marcus and Sofia always run sequentially, then only ONE expert responds per turn.
```

## The Architecture:
```
root_agent (LlmAgent with routing)
├── planner_executor_pipeline (SequentialAgent - always runs first)
│   ├── planner_agent (Marcus)
│   └── executor_agent (Sofia)
├── database_agent (Priya - conditional)
├── api_agent (James - conditional)
└── cloud_agent (Aisha - conditional)
